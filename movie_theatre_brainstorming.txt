Movie Theatre ERA Diagram Notes:


 
Brainstorming:
Concession----> Customer (many to one relationship:for every customer there are many concession, but for every concession there is one customer)

Movie---->Ticket (one to many relationship: for every ticket there is one movie,but for every movie there are many tickets)

Ticket----> Customer (for one ticket there is one customer, but for one customer there are many tickets--many to one)


Below is how the ERA diagram was created:

1. concession to customer: many to one relationship:for every customer there are many concession, but for every concession there is one customer); small theatre that only has once concession

2. customer to ticket: for one ticket there is one customer, but for one customer there are many tickets--many to one)

3. ticket to movie: for one movie there are many tickets, but for one ticket there is one movie
